# Reduction of Second Order Linear PDEâ€™s to Canonical Form in SageMath

### What is this repo about?

This is an old repository that I mostly keep for history. I polished it up a bit and added some documentation. It is a SageMath script that reduces a second order linear PDE to its canonical form.

### How to run
The easiest method is to just paste the source code to the following website: https://sagecell.sagemath.org/
